### Technologies
This site is mainly made with Next.JS. It also uses CSS for styling. 

### Future Plans
- Add more items
- Add more information about the page and about items
- Add better navigation around the site

### What I learned
Next.JS is really cool. This is my first project with it, and the routing functionality is awesome. I also learned github pages is annoying to use with Next.JS.
